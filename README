    Prompt gave information on python3 struct module which I used to pack the header information between client and server.
    Prompt inspired my creation of recv_n_bytes helper function, used to properly receive the stream of bytes from the TCP connection.

    Prompt gave info on how to properly use the select() function for the needs of the assignment. Because the assignment only orchestrated a 1 way connection from client to server, not all of select()s capabilities were needed.
